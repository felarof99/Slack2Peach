# Slack2Peach ([website](http://slack2peach.cloudapp.net/))

A 3rd party open source Slack Client for Peach - built using unannounced [API endpoints](https://gist.github.com/ummjackson/4db1da44c509576c1d1b) intercepted from the official iOS app.

The app communicates directly with the Peach API servers, so you can rest assured that any data transmitted or received is safe and secure (including login credentials).
